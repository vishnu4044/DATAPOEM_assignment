# Problem statement:(first question)

Create a product list API that must return X number of products. It should include name, price, description, date of manufacture, stocks and any other fields that you might think are relevant. The products can be stored in any DB of your choice (Must have at least 200 products). And develop a web app that must reflect the contents of the product list API and must fulfill three basic functional requirements.
1. Create a login system where users can signup or login. On logging in, it shows them their profile and wallet. They can add money to this wallet using an API. (Dummy transaction.) 
2.  In the profile screen, users can enter a location and it will show the weather in that location.
3.  The user should be able to view the dummy products in a dashboard and can buy them using the money in the wallet. This should cause his wallet to be updated along with the stock of the product
